    "Is this it" is one of my favorite albums, a lot of the songs are very simple but impossible to get out of your head when it gets in there. Most songs are kind of under the general theme of "I'm in my twenties and it's not as great as I expected it to be", and I could rant about it for hours (but I won't yet). I feel like if I had to pick an album to represent me, it would be this.
