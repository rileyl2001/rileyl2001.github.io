    I don't follow a lot of artists, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be René Magritte.
    <br>
    He makes a lot of surreal paintings that make you ask a lot of questions wondering how this would be possible,
    <br>
    "The Glass Key" is a great example of this, how did this massive object get there? Why is this called the glass key? Why was this made?
    <br>
    I love the absurdity of it all, that's probably what makes him my favorite.
